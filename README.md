👋 Hi there, and welcome to my profile 🤘!
- 🙂 My name is Radoslav, and I hail from the charming town of Pomorie, Bulgaria.
- 💞️ I’m a passionate Web Developer focused on creating engaging web UIs, websites, and web apps, specializing in Front-End development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vue.js.
- 💻 Currently, I work as a Front-End Developer, primarily using JavaScript and Vue.js, while also dabbling in Back-End development with technologies like C# .NET Core, Entity Framework API, Microsoft SQL Server, Firebase, and Supabase.
- 🧑‍💻 In my spare time, I stay connected to the first JavaScript framework I ever learned—React.
- 📱 I’m also working on building a mobile app using FlutterFlow.
- 🌊 Living by the sea, I’ve created an informative website about my hometown. Originally built with React, I’m currently refactoring and migrating it to Vue.js. Check out the pinned project or visit pomorie-info.com.
