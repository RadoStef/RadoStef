- 🙂👋🏻 Greetings! My name is @Radoslav from the charming town of Pomorie, Bulgaria.
- 💞️ I am Front-end developer passionate about creating web UI, websites and web apps, particularly the Front-End part using HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Vue JS.
- 💻 Currently immersed in continuous learning and working as a front-end developer, with JavaScript and Vue JS. In my free time I also try to stay tuned to the first framework Ive ever learned - React.
- 💻 Over the past few months, I've successfully executed several projects using Vue JS.
- 🌊 Residing by the sea, Ive crafted an informative website about my city using React, but currently I am refactoring and migrating it to Vue. Feel free to explore the pinned project or visit https://pomorie-info.com.
